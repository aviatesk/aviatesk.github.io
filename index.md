# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Shuhei. This is my homepage.
You can hover over the top right terminal and see my [blog posts](/posts), or something other.

If you have any questions or comments, you can open an issue at the [aviatesk.github.io repository](https://github.com/aviatesk/aviatesk.github.io),
or reach me on the [Julia slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) by mentioning my handle `@aviatesk`.

## Projects

- \collapsible{[Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing}{
* Improved the accuracy of abstract-interpretation based type inference by incorporating
  interprocedural and backward type constraint propagation ([JuliaLang/julia#38905](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/38905)).
* Improved implementation of constant-propagation heuristics of type inference
  ([JuliaLang/julia#39305](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/39305), [JuliaLang/julia#41383](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/41383)).
* Implemented a new callsite inlining support as well as improved the inlining algorithm
  ([JuliaLang/julia#41328](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/41328)).
* Designed and introduced a new escape analysis routine into Julia’s compilation system,
  that leverages high-level language semantics as well as interprocedural information ([JuliaLang/julia#43800](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/43800)).
* Refactored the main abstract interpretation implementation so that it manages its state
  more sparsely and generally uses less memory ([JuliaLang/julia#45276](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/45276)).
}

- \collapsible{[JET.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl), an experimental static code analyzer for Julia}{
* Designed a novel type-level static analyzer for Julia, employing its type inference system for bug detection.
* Wrote [grad-thesis](https://github.com/aviatesk/grad-thesis), my undergraduate thesis about JET.jl (currently only available in Japanese).
}

- \collapsible{[Juno](https://junolab.org/), an open-source IDE project for Julia, which features its dynamic and interactive coding experience}{
* Developed a wide variety of IDE features including inference-powered code completion,
  static code analysis features like definition-jump, and various GUI supports.
}

- \collapsible{[julia-vscode](https://www.julia-vscode.org/), a popular open-source Julia IDE widely used in the community}{
* Implemented its interactive coding features such as inline code evaluation and stack-trace highlights.
