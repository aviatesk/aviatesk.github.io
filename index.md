## Projects

Here're my side-projects:

  - [grad-thesis](https://github.com/aviatesk/grad-thesis), my undergraduate thesis about JET.jl (currently only avaiable in Japanese)

I'm a maintainer of:
- [julia-vscode](https://www.julia-vscode.org/), an IDE for Julia that offers both static language server features and dynamic coding environment
- [Juno](https://junolab.org/), an unique, dynamic and interactive IDE for Julia
- [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen), the Atom plugin to interact with Jupyter kernels within the editor

... and I'm a committer of miscellaneous OSS projects, mainly related to Julia.
